# COVID 19 Updates

Due to the evolving Coronavirus pandemic, we **do not plan to meet in person during the fall of 2020.**

We are **currently** planning the following schedule from October - December:

_Tuesday 6-7pm_: Full Team Meeting

_Tuesday 7pm-8pm_: Optional discussion hour

_Thursday 6-7pm_: Subteam & Committee meetings

_Thursday 7pm-8pm_: Optional discussion hour

We will continue to evolve this plan as needed.

All meetings will be conducted virtually. They will focus on skill building and background information in prep for the 2021 build season.

We **tentatively** plan to resume hands-on, in-person meetings in January 2021.

Keep an eye out here for details on an Open House for new students in September.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation!
