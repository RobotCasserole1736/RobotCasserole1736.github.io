# COVID 19 Updates

We are **currently** planning the following schedule from October 1st through mid-December:

_Tuesday 6-7pm_: Full Team Meeting

_Thursday 6-7pm_: Subteam & Committee meetings

All meetings will be conducted **virtually**. 

We **do not plan to meet in person during the fall of 2020.**  We will focus on skill building and background information in prep for the 2021 build season.

We **tentatively** plan to resume hands-on, in-person meetings in January 2021.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation!
