# COVID 19 Updates

We are **currently** planning the following schedule from October 1st through mid-December:

All meetings will be conducted **virtually**. 

We **do not plan to meet in person during the fall of 2020.**  We will focus on skill building and background information in prep for the 2021 build season.
