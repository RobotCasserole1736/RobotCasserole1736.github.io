  <p> No team can get off the ground without the generous support of sponsors! </p>

  <p> We are currently in search of about $3000 worth of sponsorship. This will help cover student travel fees for the World Championships in Detroit, as well as advanced tooling for summer student projects.</p>

  <p> We are also interested in in-kind sponsorships: Materials, parts, labor, and educational opportunities are always well appreciated.</p>

  <p> We seek to build relationships with companies who can impact our community: as you help us deliver STEM education to students, so too can we bring recognition and technical assistance to your company and brand.</p>

  <p> If you are interested in sponsoring, please reach out to us at frc1736@gmail.com.</p>
