# COVID-19 Policy

This page describes the current COVID-19 response and policy of FRC1736, Robot Casserole. Compliance with this document is a condition of team participation for all students, mentors, parents, and visitors of the team.

# Purpose

FRC Team 1736 believes a successful season requires meeting in person, at facilities well-suited to learning and constructing a robot, in the hopes we may attend events in the 2022 FRC competition. This policy exists to help limit the risks participants are exposed to, ensuring we have the best chance at a successful season.

# Development and Ownership

This policy is developed by FRC Team 1736 Robot Casserole.
It is enforced by mentors of Team 1736 as a condition of our usage of our build space.

# Low Community Level Requirements

Aligning with CDC guidelines for a [Community Level of Low](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html#:~:text=If%20the%20area%20has%20fewer,%25%3A%20The%20level%20is%20low.), masking, social distancing, and capacity limits are no longer required. Team members may continue to wear a mask if they desire.

# Symptom- and Contact- Free Participation

Individuals must stop participation in all in-person team activities if any of the following occur:

 * They exhibit [CDC-defined symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)
 * They receive test results indicating an active COVID-19 infection
 * They have been exposed to an individual with a active COVID-19 infection for more than 15 cumulative minutes

Individuals may resume team participation when:

* 5 days from the onset of symptoms or latest exposure AND 
* Fever free for 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medication

The team reserves the right to perform a temperature check of any member at the warehouse.

If an individual is under any form of medical quarantine, they must not attend team events in person.
Failure to attend meetings due to legitimate medical concerns will not be held against a studentâ€™s participation record (particularly for travel). Each case will be handled individually.

# Positive Exposure Procedure

If a team member believes they have caused one or more team members to be exposed to a COVID-19 infection while at the warehouse, they are asked to report this to the mentor team through an email. In turn, the mentor team will notify impacted individuals on the team to advise quarantine and testing actions.

# Handling of Medical Information

Members are not required to submit any particularly medical data to the team. However, team members are required to follow medical guidance specific to their particular condition.

# Contingency and Non-Continuation of Meetings

The Mentor Team will regularly review current COVID infection rates and Hospital/ICU availability in our area. At their discretion, team meetings may be limited or ended as a pandemic-mitigating measure.

At this time, the next review date is set for when the Peoria County Community Level returns to a "High" level by CDC metrics.

# Violations

This policy is to be treated with the same importance as our team safety policies. Knowledge of the policy is expected of every team member. The policy is to be followed in its entirety, without exception or modification. Warnings for non-compliance should not be expected. Egregious or repeat violations will result in immediate removal from the team.
